# RoleSim*

RoleSim* is a similarity measure introduced in the paper ``RoleSim*: Scaling axiomatic role-based similarity ranking on large graphs''. This measure combines the strengths of both SimRank and RoleSim while effectively addressing some of their limitations.
This repository contains the C++ implementation of the following algorithms:

- **RS***: RoleSim* 
- **Ths-RS***: Threshold-based RoleSim* 
- **SSRS***: Single Source RoleSim*
  
- **SR**: Original [SimRank](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/775047.775126)
- **RS**: Original [RoleSim](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2020408.2020561)
