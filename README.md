# RoleSim*

RoleSim* is a similarity measure introduced in the paper [Link to Paper]. This measure, combines the strengths of both SimRank and RoleSim while effectively addressing some of their limitations.
This repository contains the C++ implementation of the following algorithms:

- **SR**: Original SimRank [Reference to Original SimRank Paper]
- **RS**: Original RoleSim [Reference to Original RoleSim Paper]
- **RS***: RoleSim* as presented in [Link to RoleSim* Paper]
- **Ths-RS***: Threshold-based RoleSim* as presented in [Link to Threshold-based RoleSim* Paper]
- **SSRS***: Single Source RoleSim* as presented in [Link to Single Source RoleSim* Paper]
